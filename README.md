# cheat-sheet-layout-practice
Simple cheat sheets for all we have covered in Stream 1 so far

## Rationale
I wanted to practice the various techniques we learned in week 1 whilst also putting together something that I will personally find useful in the days and weeks to come.  Perhaps someone else will find it useful too.

## Techniques
First of all, I wanted to keep all of the styling information out of the HTML. Not only that but as I knew I would need at least 2 pages, this was the first time I have referenced an external stylesheet of my own creation.
