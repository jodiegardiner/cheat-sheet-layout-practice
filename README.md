# cheat-sheet-layout-practice
Simple cheat sheets for all we have covered in Stream 1 so far

## Rationale
I wanted to practice the various techniques we learned in week 1 whilst also putting together something that I will personally find useful in the days and weeks to come.  Perhaps someone else will find it useful too.
I found that when I wanted to access the various cheatsheets, I had to jump back and forth between the slides to find the individual cheatsheets for a particular area of study.  

## Techniques
First of all, I wanted to keep all of the styling information out of the HTML. Not only that but as I knew I would need at least 2 pages, this was the first time I have referenced an external stylesheet of my own creation.
This is also the first time I encountered the <pre><table></pre> tag but it seemed ideal for my purposes (displaying 2-column tablular data).
For all but the HTML cheatsheet, I have linked to the same urls we were given in the slides.  In html.html, I used the cheatsheets as content for my layout practice.

## Responsiveness
The "navigation" of the pages will switch to a flexbox column if the screen size is smaller than a tablet.
